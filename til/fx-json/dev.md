[fx](https://github.com/antonmedv/fx) is an interactaive JSON viewer for the terminal.

It's a simple tool built with Charmcli's Bubble Tea.

## Installation

The installation with go was broken for me - both via the link and direct from the repo. Now I'm not a gopher so I don't really know how to fix that.

Luckily `npm install fx` also works and got me what I needed!

## Usage

Usage is simple... `fx <json file>`. The Github has a few other ways such as `curl ... | fx` etc.
