I run pi-hole at home for ad blocking and some internal DNS/DHCP handling.

__pi hole posts on the way__

One thing I've never put too much thought in is asking "how well am I doing at blocking?"
There's lots of ways to measure that depending on what you care about but I just learned of [adblock tester](https://d3ward.github.io/toolz/adblock).
It's awesome and gave me a quick glimpse into how my pi-hole is performing on keeping my webpages clean and my DNS history private!
