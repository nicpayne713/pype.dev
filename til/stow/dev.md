Stow is a great tool for managing dotfiles. My usage looks like cloning my dotfiles to my home directory, setting some environment variables via a script, then stowing relevant packages and boom my config is good to go...

```bash
cd ~ git clone <my dotfiles repo> cd dotfiles
# env variable stuff ignored here
stow zsh  # This will symlink my .zshrc file which is in ~/dotfiles/zsh to ~/.zshrc
```
By default stow will stow packages up one directory from the root directory.  In this example the root directory is `~/dotfiles` and the package is `zsh`. So the files in the `zsh` package will symlinked into `~/`.

`stow` makes it easy to share dotfiles across machines, or safely experiment with config changes while always being protected by `git` since your dotfiles are in a git repo!
...They are in a git repo... right?
